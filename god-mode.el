;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines the following mapping:
;;
;; 1. All commands are assumed to be C-<something> unless otherwise
;;    indicated. Examples:
;;    * a    -> C-a
;;    * s    -> C-s
;;    * akny -> C-a C-k C-n C-y
;;
;; 2. `g' is a special key to indicate M-<something>. This means that
;;    there is no way to write `C-g' in this mode, you must therefore
;;    type `C-g' directly. Examples:
;;    * gf -> M-f
;;    * gx -> M-f
;;
;; 3. `x' is a special key to indicate C-x <something>. Examples:
;;    * xb -> C-x b
;;    * xh -> C-x h
;;
;; 4. `c' is a special key to indicate C-c <something>. Examples:
;;    * ca -> C-c a
;;    * cc -> C-c c
;;
;; 5. `h' is a special key to indicate C-h <something>. Examples:
;;    * hh -> C-h h
;;    * hf -> C-h f
;;
;; 6. There is a convention of uppercase special keys to indicate
;;    two modifier keys in action. Those are:
;;    * Gx -> C-M-x
;;    * Xs -> C-x C-s
;;    * Xx -> C-x C-x
;;    * Cc -> C-c C-c
